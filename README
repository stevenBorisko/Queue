This is a struct called Queue that is a
generic stack data structure.

This, like all the other C data structure repositories on my Github,
was made so that neither you nor I will ever have to rewrite any of them
again for any other projects in the future.

Functions of a Queue (documentation in header file)

Creating a Queue
Queue Queue_init();
Queue* Queue_create();

Insertion and removal
void Queue_enqueue(Queue* queue, void* data);
void* Queue_dequeue(Queue* queue);

Miscellaneous
void* Queue_front(const Queue* queue);
void* Queue_back(const Queue* queue);
int Queue_isEmpty(const Queue* queue);
unsigned int Queue_count(const Queue* queue);
void Queue_clear(Queue* queue, void (*destroy)(void*));
