Generic queue data structure

This, like all the other C data structure repositories on my Github,
was made so that neither you nor I will ever have to rewrite any of them
again for any other projects in the future.

Full documentation on usage is found in Queue.h

Structs:
	struct QueueNode:
		- Wrapper struct for storing data in a Queue

Queue Insertion and Removal Functions:
	void Queue_enqueue(Queue* queue, void* data)
		- Inserts a new element to the back of the queue
	void Queue_preempt(Queue* queue, void* data)
		- Inserts a new element to the front of the queue
	void* Queue_dequeue(Queue* queue)
		- Removes the element at the front of the queue and returns it

	void* Queue_front(const Queue* queue);
		- Returns the front of the queue
	void* Queue_back(const Queue* queue);
